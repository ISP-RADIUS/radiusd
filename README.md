Radius Server.
===================
Simple Radius-server to do authentication+accounting.
Motivation for writing this was the overengineerd 'freeradius' that
was hard to patch. Adjusting this project to your needs should be
a breeze!

This daemon uses MariaDB/MySQL to store it's data and the SQL-file can
be found in the `/db` dir.

TODO
====================
- IP CIDR check
